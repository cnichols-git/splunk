##
#Splunk getting started
#

## First do not install as root

## Adding splunk to your environment var to you do not have to go to /opt/splunk/bin to run splunk commands
$ vi ~/.bashrc
 export SPLUNK_HOME="/opt/splunkforwarder"
 export PATH=$PATH:$SPLUNK_HOME/bin 
$ exec bash

## For the system that has Splunk installed on it, not the host that has a forwarder

# Go to /opt/slunkforwarder/bin and do the following, if splunk is not in your env

./splunk start â€”accept-license
./splunk start
./splunk enable boot-start 
./splunk status 

# Add the ports and then restart Splunk
- firewall-cmd --add-port=8000/tcp --add-port=8089/tcp --add-port=8191/tcp --add-port=8065/tcp --add-port=9997/tcp
success

**I turned off the firewall, but will test with opening the ports when I have time

# Go to the WUI and then Settings > Forwarding and receiving > Receive data > choose Configure Receiving
- here you will add the port that you are using ex. 9997

##For the system that has a SplunkForwader installed on it
./splunk restart - this is on the system that has splunk monitoring

#List the setup forwarders
- ./splunk list forward-server

ENow tell the forwarder what to send for monitoring
- ./splunk add monitor /var/log/messages

ENow restart splunk
- ./splunk restart
