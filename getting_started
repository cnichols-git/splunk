#Splunk getting started
#

First do not install as root

$ vi ~/.bashrc
 export SPLUNK_HOME="/opt/splunkforwarder"
 export PATH=$PATH:$SPLUNK_HOME/bin 
$ exec bash

Go to /opt/slunkforwarder/bin and do the following 

./splunk start â€”accept-license
./splunk start
./splunk enable boot-start 
./splunk status


For the host that has Splunk installed on it 

Add the ports and then restart Splunk
firewall-cmd --add-port=8000/tcp --add-port=8089/tcp --add-port=8191/tcp --add-port=8065/tcp --add-port=9997/tcp
success

./splunk restart - this is on the system that has splunk monitoring

List the setup forwarders
./splunk list forward-server

Now tell the forwarder what to send for monitoring
./splunk add monitor /var/log/messages

Now restart splunk
./splunk restart

**I turned off the firewall, but will test with opening the ports when I have time
